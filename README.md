# timbryan-dev

This repo is for the development of my portofio site which can be viewed over at [https://timbryan.dev/](https://timbryan.dev/)

I'm hoping to expand on what I have already into something bigger such as a blog

## Dependencies

- npm/node
- browser sync
- gulp
- prettier
- typescript

## Commands

`npm install` - must be ran before any others below to install all dependencies

`npm build` - runs a gulp script that will build a local version of the whole project

`npm watch` - runs a gulp script that will build a local version of the whole project and runs browser-sync to send any watched folders to the web browser

`npm format` - runs a prettier script to nicely format the ts, scss and html files
